### Submitted By : Jahed Hasan



## Introduction    
>Student report card system project in C++ is a simple console application built without the use of graphics. In this project, users can perform typical report card related functions like adding a new student record and displaying, modifying, editing and deleting it. File handling has been effectively used to perform all these.       


## Theory   
>In this student report card project built with Object oriented programming. Here, I used Classes , Inheritance, Exception handling, File handling, Array etc.It’s full functional application. Users can simply insert user data, and make a progress report card.

## Features of Student Report Card Project in C++:

### Add student record  
>This feature creates a new student record        
containing his marks. For this the information to be provided are the name and roll no. of the student, and the marks obtained by him/her in 5 subjects  - Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics,Programming and English.

## Search student record 
>Read specific student’s record: This feature is the same as the first one         
explained above, except it shows the progress report and relevant data related to a particular student.

## Modify student record
>Modify student’s record: In student report card system project in C++,  
this feature is used to edit the report card record of a particular student. For
this, the roll no. of the student is sought. If no record of student is found in
file, it displays the message “Student Roll NO. Not Found....”.

## Delete student record  
>This feature deletes the report card record of a
particular student; it first of all asks for the roll no. of the student whose record
is to be deleted.After deleted it displays the message “Successfully Deleted”.  

## Display all student record   
>The void display() function in this student
report card system project in C++ has been used for this feature. It basically
shows the list of all the student records added in the file

## Generate report   
>This feature generates the report card of a particular
student, it first of all asks for the roll no. of the student whose report is to be
made.
